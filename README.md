Chat Bot
This repository hosts a Flask-based chat bot application designed to provide a flexible and extendable platform for creating AI-driven chat interfaces. The bot can be integrated with various Natural Language Processing (NLP) services, such as OpenAI or Google Dialogflow, to enhance its conversational abilities.

Features
Flask Web Framework: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight and easy-to-use Python web framework. This makes the chat bot highly modular and adaptable to different use cases.

Modular Structure: The code is organized in a way that allows for easy customization and extension. You can add new routes, views, and logic without affecting the core functionality.

NLP Integration Ready: The chat bot is set up to integrate with NLP services, enabling it to process and respond to user inputs more intelligently. This can be useful for applications that require natural language understanding, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
